# LookingGlass Next Steps

In order to continue development of this project, two repositories will need to be forked and set up:

## Backend

[Backend Repo](https://github.com/FreshFoodies/FreshFoodies)


Run flask backend with
```
flask run
```

You will need to set up a new MongoDB cluster and download [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass). References to the MongoDB cluster link will need to be changed throughout the backend repository.

In addition, you will need to set up a new Heroku account and [deploy this Flask app to Heroku](https://realpython.com/flask-by-example-part-1-project-setup/). The ideal set up is to have changes to the main production branch automatically update the Heroku branch.


## Frontend

[Frontend Repo](https://github.com/FreshFoodies/FreshFoodies)


Run expo frontend with
```
npm start
```

Any references to the old Heroku backend API will need to be switched to your new Heroku link throughout the frontend repository.
